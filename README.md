**Exp 1-a** : Image Resizing - Thia is the concept that involves changing the dimensions of an image while maintaining its quality and content. It is also known as image scaling which used to increase or reduce the size of an image. This can be done to fit the image in specific space.
**Exp 1-b** : Image Rotation - This operation involves rotating an image by a certain angle clockwise or otherwise, typically measured in dergee. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. The scale factor can be used to scale the image up or down. A scale factor of 1 will keep the image the same size, while a scale factor of 2 will double the size of the python image.
**Exp 1-c** : Image Translation - Image translation also known as image shifting. This opeeration involves moving an image by a certain amount in the x-axis and y-axis while maintaining its size and orientation.
**Exp 1-d** : Image Shearing - Image Shearing is a geometric transformation in image processing that involves shifting the pixels of an image in a specific direction, while keeping the other dimensions unchanged. This geometric transformation is used to correct or manipulate the orientation of an image. It can be performed in various directions, such as horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
**Exp 1-e** : Image Normalization - This process involves scaling the pixel values of an image to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to improve the contrast and visibility of the image. It reduces the effects of variations in lighting, contrast and other factors that can affect the appearance of the image. This is done to improve the visibility and interpretability of the image and to prepare it for further processing and analysis.
**Exp 1-f** : Edge detection of Image - These process involves detecting sharp edges in the image. This edge detection is essential in the context of image recognition or object localization/detection. In order to detect edges, the Canny edge detector first smoothes the image to reduce noise, then computes its gradient and then applies a threshold to the gradient.
**Exp 1-g** : Image Blurring - Image blurring is a fundamental concept in image processing that involves reducing the sharpness and clarity of an image by averaging the pixel values. This is typically done by applying a filter or kernel to the image, which replaces each pixel value with a weighted average of the neighboring pixel values.
**Exp 1-h** : Morphological Image Processing - Morphology is the study of the shape and structure of objects. It is the technique used in image processing to analyze and manipulate the shape and structure of objects within an image. It involves using mathematical operations to modify the image based on its shape and size. These procedures are commonly used to eliminate noise, separate objects, and detect edges in images.
